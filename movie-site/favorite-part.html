        <h1>Ending Scene</h1>
        <p>
            After long fight between Thaos and Avengers for control of Infinity Stones, Thanos wins 
            the war when he collects all six of them. Then, with 
            a snap of his fingers, he accomplishes what he sets out to doâ€”wipe out half the 
            universe at random. This ends up killing beloved characters like Spider-Man, Black 
            Panther, all of the Guardians of the Galaxy except Rocket and Nebula, and more. 
            There are still major superheroes on the board like Iron Man, Thor, and Captain 
            America, but half the universe is just gone, and Thanos is happily watching the sun 
            rise, still in possession of the Infinity Gauntlet and all the Stones (although it looks 
            like the gauntlet was damaged after he snapped his fingers).
