	    <h2>Thanos</h2>
	    <p>An intergalactic despot from Titan who longs to collect all six
 of the Infinity Stones in order to impose his will on all of reality, wanting 
to "re-balance the universe". Thanos believes the universe is becoming over-populated, 
which led to the destruction of his home moon Titan and is something he vowed not 
to let happen again.</p>

	    <h2>Iron Man</h2>
	    <p>The leader and benefactor of the Avengers, who is a self-described 
genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of

the Earth safe".</p>

	    <p>An android and Avenger created using the artificial intelligence 
J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, and the Mind Stone. Anthony Russo called Vision "a 
living MacGuffin. Obviously, that raises the stakes because Vision's life is 
in danger, and his life is in conflict with Thanos' goals, so something's got 
to give."</p>
