            <h1>Russo Brothers</h1>
            <p>Joe Russo (Feb. 3, 1970) and his brother Anthony Russo (Jul. 8, 1971) were raised 
                in Cleveland. Their student film "PIECES" caught the attention of Academy AwardÂ®-winning 
                director Steven Soderbergh after he saw it at the 1997 Slamdance Film Festival. Soderberghcalled 
                them a week later, telling them that he wanted to produce their next project. He asked 
                them whether they wanted to direct their own material, or if they wanted him to connect 
                them to another screenplay. The Russos told him they would prefer to direct their own 
                script and over the next couple of years they wrote intensely, finally coming up with 
                the screenplay Welcome To Collinwood (2002).The brothers tried their hand successfully 
                at television, directing the pilot episode of LAX as well as several episodes of the 
                hit series Arrested Development before returning to the big screen with You, Me and 
                Dupree (2006), starring Owen Wilson and Kate Hudson. Recently, the two have co-directed 
                the Captain America movies Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America: 
                Cvil War (2016). Continuing with that superhero theme, their newest directing credit will 
                be Avengers: Infinity War (2018).
