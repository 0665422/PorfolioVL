    Many companies research and already sell their Smart Home systems. Among them: Amazon Echo, Google Assistant, Nest, Hive, and many others.
    Most of the Smart Home products <b>don't</b> work with each other, because they are competitors. For example, home temperature system does not communicate with lightning system and etc.
    By <b>2030</b>, Smart Home systems are expected to become more efficient, functional, widespread, and affordable.
